# Data structures & Algorithms
## Description
I have used some interesting data structures in competitive programming. I decided to keep them here. 
Most of the programs are not meant to be read by humans so they will difficult to read.
I have also added some codes from my data structures course at uni.


## Acknowledgments

I have only managed to learn so much thanks to many online free sources that provide solutions and problems:
* [Usaco Guide](https://usaco.guide/)
* [CPalgorithms](https://cp-algorithms.com/)
* [CSES problemset](https://cses.fi/problemset/list)
* [Handbook](https://cses.fi/book/book.pdf)
